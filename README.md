All steps are contained within the model_train_deploy/model_train_deploy.ipynb notebook.  
The notebook cells document each step of the training and deploying process.

To run, clone the repo in the AWS Sagemaker Studio Environment (https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio/) and open model_train_deploy.ipynb.

You may have to create Service Requests (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html) for Training and Endpoint instances as necessary.

The fine tuning dataset is in final_dataset.csv.
